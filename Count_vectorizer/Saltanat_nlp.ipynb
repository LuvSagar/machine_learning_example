    "NLP in machine learning has many branches, suppose you wanted to predict the next word of a sentence or classify a book a review as negative or positive. These examples involve the data being in the form of words, depending on your task at hand you will need to represent your text data in a usable form so an algorithm can work.  "

    "\n",
    "At Yapily we look at transactional data, as you may know, this data is relatively short for each transaction and doesn't have any emotive meaning to it like a movie review (trying to class a reviews as negative or positive is a branch of NLP called Sentimental analysis). However, each transaction has a category (EATING_OUT, INCOME .. etc) and so at Yapily we are trying to build a model that will place an unknow transaction into the right category. For this to work we need to train a model on all the labelled data; so when that model sees a new transaction that has not been labelled we can place it in the right category at least with a high probability. For example, if the model sees TESCO then it will hopefully place that transaction in the Groceries category.\n",
